# Molecular-Formula

A tool to calculate molecular formula, molecular weight and mole and weight fractions from an entered chemical formula.

The molecular formula is given following the Hill System.

Molecular weight value and standard deviation are calculated using atomic weight values from the
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, Commission on isotopic abundances and atomic weights
( https://www.ciaaw.org/atomic-weights.htm ).

The molecular weight is given with the standard deviation in the last decimal place in parentheses following the value.

A table of the Atomic % and Weight % (to 3 decimal places) for each element is also given.
